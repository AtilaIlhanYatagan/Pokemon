# Pokedex
Pokedex is a pokemon listing app that you can inspect the attributes and the images of the pokemons.
This is the native android application that I created for my 2022 summer intership at Softtech

## Technologies
- The project follows **MVVM** structure,
- **Jetpack Navigation** and Bottom Navigation for navigating,
- **Glide** for image processing,
- **Retrofit** and **Kotlin Coroutines** for Network calls,
- **Room** Database for local storage
